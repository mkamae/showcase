# TutorAI

## Overview

TutorAI is a virtual teacher powered by artificial intelligence, designed for students between 6 and 18 years old. Our mission is to turn homework and learning into an engaging, personalized, and fun experience.
Why is this important? In Argentina, kids lose on average more than 20 school days per year due to strikes, holidays, and absences — nearly a whole month without academic continuity. On top of that, attention spans are getting shorter in a digital world full of instant entertainment.
TutorAI solves both problems by blending AI-driven education with the engagement strategies of live streamers, ensuring kids stay focused, curious, and motivated.
We leverage ElevenLabs technology for real-time Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT), making learning accessible even for kids who don’t yet know how to read or write.

## Key Features

- Personalized Learning: Lessons adapt to the student’s preferences, style, and level, ensuring a unique path for each child.
- Streamer-Like Interface: Inspired by live streaming, with avatars and memes (like Edulcito) to keep attention high.
- Voice Interaction: Powered by ElevenLabs TTS + STT, enabling students to speak naturally and get instant feedback.
- Customizable Avatars: Kids can create their own characters, keeping the learning process fun and relatable.
- Real-Time Illustrations: Integration with Nano-Banana for on-demand image generation, helping explain complex ideas visually.

## How It Works

1. Student Interaction: The student either types or speaks (using STT) to TutorAI.
2. AI Response: The AI processes the input, adapts the explanation to the student’s style, and enriches it with examples.
3. Engagement Layer: Responses are presented through a streamer-like interface, with avatars, memes, and visuals.
4. Accessibility: For younger students, ElevenLabs TTS reads responses out loud, making the experience inclusive.
5. Real-Time Media: When concepts need reinforcement, TutorAI generates images or other media to keep curiosity alive.

## Architecture at a glance

- Frontend: Web app with interactive, game-like UI.
- Backend: AI-driven engine orchestrating responses, personalization, and integrations.
- APIs: ElevenLabs (TTS, STT), Nano-Banana (image gen), plus custom AI models.

## Technologies Used

- ElevenLabs API
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Nano-Banana (real-time image generation)
- OpenAI / LLM APIs (for tutoring intelligence)
- Next.js + React (frontend)
- Node.js / Express (backend services)

## Getting Started

### 1. Set up environment variables

Copy the example environment file and update it with your own API keys (e.g., ElevenLabs, Nano-Banana, etc.):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit .env with your credentials.

### 2. Run with docker
```bash
docker compose up
```

### 3. Access the app

Open http://localhost:3000
 in your browser.
