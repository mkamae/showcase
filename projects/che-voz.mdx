# Che Voz - AI Voice Assistant Platform

## Overview

Che Voz is an innovative AI voice assistant platform that brings natural Spanish conversations to life with region-specific dialects. Built with ElevenLabs' conversational AI, it offers authentic voice interactions for users across Latin America and Spain, automatically suggesting the most appropriate agent based on the user's location.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Dialect Support**: Five specialized agents covering Argentine (Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Mendoza), Mexican, and Colombian Spanish accents
- **Location-Based Intelligence**: Automatically detects user location and suggests the most culturally appropriate voice agent
- **Real-Time Voice Streaming**: Low-latency bidirectional audio using WebSocket technology
- **Modern Web Interface**: Intuitive dialer interface with visual feedback and agent suggestions
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-structured FastAPI backend with domain-driven design principles

## How It Works

Che Voz leverages ElevenLabs' Conversational AI API to create natural voice interactions. The system architecture includes:

1. **Frontend**: Modern web dialer that captures audio and handles WebSocket connections
2. **Backend**: FastAPI server that manages conversations and integrates with ElevenLabs
3. **Location Service**: Intelligent agent suggestion based on IP geolocation and browser location API
4. **Voice Processing**: Real-time audio streaming with automatic format conversion (PCM16)
