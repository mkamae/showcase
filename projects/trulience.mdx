# Bring voice to life with Trulience Interactive Avatars

## Overview

Trulience allows you to bring your ElevenLabs voices to life as Interactive Avatars. Just sign up at trulience.com for a free account and start using your ElevenLabs Agent IDs to power a range of ready-made or customised avatars, ranging from photo-realistic digital humans to 3D beings and cartoons.

## Key Features

- Control the look and feel of your avatars and their environments
- Embed them in websites and apps
- Provide a whole new level of engagement beyond pure voice

## How It Works

Inside the Trulience dashboard you'll be able to select from a range of ready-made avatars, or even create your own. Then to power your avatar with an ElevenLabs agent, all you'll need to do is select **3rd Party AI - Conversational AI Frameworks** under the BRAIN tab for that avatar and then choose **ElevenLabs Conversational AI** from the drop down. Finally, you'll need to enter the corresponding Agent ID for driving your avatar's interactions. And that's it! You'll now have an embodied digital version of your ElevenLabs agent.

## Technologies Used

- ElevenLabs Conversational AI
- Trulience Interactive Avatar Platform
- SDKs and APIs available, with further documentation found at docs.trulience.com
