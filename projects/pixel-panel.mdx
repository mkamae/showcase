# PixelPanel

## Overview

PixelPanel is a multimodal comic generator that transforms simple prompts into complete illustrated stories with narration (AI Tinkerers Ultimate Agents hackathon winning project). The project is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JamieOgun/PixelPanel).

## Key Features

- Panel-by-Panel Creation: Build your comic incrementally with simple text prompts for each panel
- Iterative Editing: Sketch modifications directly on panels or refine with additional prompts
- Voice Narration: Add professional voice-over narration using ElevenLabs text-to-speech

## How It Works

### Creating Your Comic

The workflow is simple:

**Start with a prompt**: Describe your first panel. "A superhero overlooking the city at sunset" or "a cozy coffee shop on a rainy morning."

**Generate and refine**: PixelPanel creates the image. If it's not quite right, sketch modifications or add a follow-up prompt like "make the sunset more dramatic."

**Build the story**: Move to the next panel. Each new prompt builds on your narrative, creating visual continuity across panels.

**Add narration**: Once your panels are ready, write the narrative text and generate voice-over. The audio syncs with each panel automatically.

**Export**: Download your comic as individual panels, or export as a video with narration included.

### Real Examples

**Mystery Story**
- Panel 1: "Detective examining clues in a dimly lit office"
- Panel 2: "Close-up of a mysterious letter with cryptic symbols"
- Panel 3: "Detective rushing out into the night"
- Narration: "Detective Morris knew time was running out..."

**Fantasy Adventure**
- Panel 1: "Warrior standing at the edge of an enchanted forest"
- Panel 2: "Magical creatures watching from behind ancient trees"
- Panel 3: "The warrior discovering a glowing artifact"
- Narration: "The prophecy had spoken of this moment..."

## Technologies Used

- **ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech**: Professional voice narration generation
- **Nanobanana**: AI-powered image generation with iterative editing

## Getting Started

### Using the Hosted Platform

The easiest way to get started with PixelPanel is to use our hosted platform:

1. **Visit [pixelpanel.co](https://www.pixelpanel.co/)**
2. **Sign up** for a free account
3. **Start creating** your first comic with simple text prompts
4. **Add voice narration** using ElevenLabs integration
5. **Export and share** your completed comics

### Local Development

For developers who want to run PixelPanel locally or contribute to the project, detailed setup instructions are available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JamieOgun/PixelPanel/tree/main).

The project includes:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for image generation
- **Voice**: ElevenLabs for text-to-speech narration

## What's Next?

The next major feature is character voice dialogue. Right now, PixelPanel handles narrator voice-over, but we want to add speech bubbles with actual character voices. Imagine creating a comic where each character has their own distinct voice, generated through ElevenLabs' voice cloning or character presets.

We're also exploring:
- Collaborative editing where multiple creators work on the same comic
- Integration with popular comic platforms for direct publishing
- Advanced panel layouts and transitions

Create comic with just your imagination.

Try it yourself and let us know what you create.
