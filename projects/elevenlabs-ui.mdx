[ElevenLabs UI](https://ui.elevenlabs.io) is a component library and custom registry built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to help you build multimodal agentic experiences faster. It provides pre-built components for agents, transcription, audio & more.

Components are available via the @elevenlabs/agents-cli command.

# Getting started

To install the components, you can initialize with [our CLI](https://ui.elevenlabs.io/docs/setup), and pick your components, import them, and start building.

```bash
pnpm dlx @elevenlabs/agents-cli@latest components add <component>
```

[Read the docs](https://ui.elevenlabs.io/docs) and start building better voice & agent interfaces, faster.
