# Calm Ai 

## Overview

Your AI companion for emotional wellness

Experience personalized emotional support through AI-powered conversations. CalmAI is designed to listen, understand, and help you navigate your feelings in a safe, supportive environment.I used the text to speech.Africa has low levels of therapists this intervention seeks to aid with that.

## Key Features

- Feature 1: Voice guided breathing exercises
- Feature 2: Ai Therapist
- Feature 3: Voice to text

## How It Works

Frontend (React/TypeScript)
    â†“
React Query (State Management)
    â†“
Supabase Edge Functions (Serverless Backend)
    â†“
External AI/Audio APIs # ðŸŽ¯ Key Challenges Solved - Summary

## **1. Stack Overflow in Audio Conversion**
**Problem**: Large audio buffers caused stack overflow when converting to base64  
**Solution**: Chunked processing in 32KB increments instead of converting entire buffer at once

## **2. API Reliability & Availability**
**Problem**: Single point of failure if AI service goes down  
**Solution**: Cascading fallback system (OpenAI â†’ Together AI â†’ graceful error message)

## **3. Cross-Browser Audio Compatibility**
**Problem**: Different browsers support different audio formats and constraints  
**Solution**: Progressive negotiation - tries multiple MIME types (webm/opus â†’ webm â†’ mp4 â†’ wav) and audio constraints

## **4. Text-to-Speech Availability**
**Problem**: ElevenLabs API requires paid key, limiting accessibility  
**Solution**: Fallback to browser's native Web Speech API when cloud TTS unavailable

5. Initial Load Performance
Problem: Large bundle size impacts first paint  
Solution: Code splitting with React.lazy() + Error Boundaries for graceful degradation

 6. Complex Breathing Exercise State
Problem: Managing multi-phase breathing patterns with voice guidance  
Solution: State machine with interval-based phase transitions, voice integration, and automatic cleanup

7. Accessibility for Mental Health Users
Problem: Must be usable by people in distress, including those with disabilities  
Solution: WCAG-compliant implementation with ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

8. User Experience During Failures**
Problem: Technical errors can worsen emotional distress  
Solution: Compassionate fallback messages that maintain therapeutic tone even during errors

9. Microphone Permission Errors**
Problem: Generic error messages confuse users  
Solution: Specific, actionable error messages based on error type (NotFoundError, NotAllowedError, etc.)

Core Philosophy: Graceful degradation and user empathy throughout - ensuring the app remains helpful even when external services fail.
