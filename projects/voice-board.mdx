# Voice Board

## Overview

Voice Board is an assistive, customizable communication tool for people with speech or motor impairments. It provides a grid of buttons that generate expressive speech, sound effects, and music in real time using ElevenLabs’ advanced v3 model. Designed to be used hands-free, it empowers users to communicate with emotion and creativity.

## Key Features

- Speech generation with emotional tags (e.g., [excited], [whispering], [laughing])
- AI-powered sound effect creation from text prompts
- Music generation with contextual mood or style
- Fully configurable button grid and categories
- Hover activation and mobile optimization for accessibility
- Export/import your configuration for backup

## How It Works

Voice Board runs entirely in the browser. Users add their ElevenLabs API key, then click or hover buttons to trigger ElevenLabs AI generation for speech, sound effects or music. Edit mode allows full customization of text, emoji, audio types, and emotions, with live feedback.

## Technologies Used

- ElevenLabs API (TTS with emotions, sound effects, music generation)
- JavaScript, React, CSS
- LocalStorage for persistent settings and audio backup

## Getting Started

Use immediately online, or clone locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

**Usage:**
Go to [voice-board demo](https://mull2536.github.io/voice-board), enter your ElevenLabs API key, and start communicating with expressive AI voice, sound, and music.
